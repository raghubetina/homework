= Week 2 Homework

This week, you'll use a Rails app to generate web pages on a local server.

Remember these key ideas:

* Routes map an incoming url path to a specific controller instance method.
* Controller instance methods must render a response.
* They can render a response explicitly or implicitly (using a view template).

In order for the tests to pass, be sure to have your app running on port 3000 in a separate Terminal tab while you rake the tests.
