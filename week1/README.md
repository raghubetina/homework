## Week 1 Homework

This week, you'll get practice at:

* Writing Ruby class instance methods
* Converting JSON strings into Ruby hashes
* Manipulating data contained in Ruby arrays and hashes

### Here's how to do this week's homework:

First, make sure the current directory is set into this folder.

There are three Ruby files that contain unit tests.  You can run each file individually, or run them all at once with the rake utility:

    $ rake

Each test file contains instructions at the top of each file.  You need to add application code above the test class so that the tests will pass.

You will probably need to read the test code in order to understand what's required.  Running the tests to see the failure messages is another great way to know what to do next.
